<h1>Aim</h1>
<p>I have a background in graphic designer and looking to pursue career in UX/UI industry. Therefore, my aim in this course is more towards understanding basic HTML and CSS. I think it would be beneficial for me to understand what limitation HTML and CSS has, so I can design website or online content that is more align with what the developer can do.</p>

<h1>My Site</h1>
<p>In this opportunity, I decided to create a website about my family. The website layout will be simple, but adapting the industry styles and standard. I purposely created a common-looked website so I might know and aware of the coding of certain layout I would likely to use in the future.</p>

<h1>Outline</h1>
<h3>Header</h3>
<p>The website starts with the opening header. My initial plan for this header is to have a hero image with quotes overlay. 
I figured out that we can put text overlay on 5 placements: top-left, top-right, centered, bottom-left, bottom-right. I ended up putting my site title on the top-left and a quote on the bottom-right.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>This section is divided into 2 column, one for picture and one for text.</p1>

<h3>Our Members</h3>
<p>Our members section is meant to display 7 people with small introduction each. I adapted this layout from 'Meet My Team' instruction guide and made it simpler to meet my need. At first, it turned out so big and filled the whole screen. I adjusted the padding in each side to shrink the column into my desired size. It also added extra white space that makes the page looks clean.</p1>

<h3>Our Memories</h3>
<p>This section is meant to be simple and displayed a collage of images. I discovered that this can be achieved by creating column as well. It turns out well and exactly how I want it to be.</p1>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p> This was my first experience with HTML and CSS. To be honest, at first, I was struggling to make sense how coding works. I am not familiar with the term and we only have short amount of time. As I try to work on this assesment, I started to be more familiar with some of the commands and it might not be as hard as it looks. However, it also takes so much time to figure out an error once some things don't work as it supposed to be. But I think that's where I learn! ðŸ˜Š</p1>
